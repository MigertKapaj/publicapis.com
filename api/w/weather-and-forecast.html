if you are looking for a *weather* API then you search is over! 
Metwit born as a crowdsourced platform for gathering *real-time* weather reports from real people. 
After more then ten thousand users started to using our apps and send a massive amount of reports,  
we decided to release those precious reports through our APIs.   

And that&#39;s not all: we&#39;re also offering a single gateway for multiple, hard to parse, sources of forecasts 
like NOAA, and we&#39;re enhancing  them with social data like photos, tweets, etc., that we leverage from existing 
social networks.
