Aside from social applications, organizations are also looking to surface their core enterprise business functionality to an ever expanding array of client platforms. WCF Web API allows developers to expose their applications, data and services to the web directly over HTTP. This allows developers to fully harness the richness of the HTTP as an application layer protocol. Applications can communicate with a very broad set of clients whether they be browsers, mobile devices, desktop applications or other backend services. They can also take advantage of the caching and proxy infrastructure of the web through providing proper control and entity headers. We are designing specifically to support applications built with a RESTful architecture style though it does not force developers to use REST. The benefits of REST for your applications include discoverability, evolvability and scalability.">  <meta name=google-site-verification content=""> <link rel=canonical href="http://www.publicapis.com/api/w/wcf-web.html/">  <link href=/assets/css/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css> <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600,800,300" rel=stylesheet type=text/css> <link href=//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.1.0/css/font-awesome.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css> </head> <body> <header> <div class=container> <h1><span class=public>Public</span><span class=apis>APIs</span></h1> <h2><span class=gray>by</span><a href=http://mashape.com>Mashape</a><span class=light>API Marketplace</span></h2> <div class=row> <div class=search> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"> <label>We have 4367 Public APIs in our Database</label> <form> <div class=form-group><span class="fa fa-search"></span> <input placeholder="Search though thousands of APIs..." class=form-control> </div> </form> </div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <div class=container> <div class="api detail"> <div class=logo> <span class=helper></span> <img src=/assets/logos/wcf-web/logo.png> </div> <h1>WCF Web</h1> <p>Applications are continually evolving to expose their functionality over the web for example social services likeFlickr, Twitter andFacebook.
