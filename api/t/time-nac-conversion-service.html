A two-character NAC roughly represents an area about 1000 km in easting and 750 km in northing (here easting means the distance from the west edge to the east edge of the area and northing means the distance from the south edge to the north edge of the area). A four-character NAC, an area of 30 km by 25 km. A six-character NAC, one square kilometer area. An eight-character NAC, 25 m by 30 m and a ten-character NAC is approximately one square meter anywhere in the world.
