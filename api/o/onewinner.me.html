In lotteries (Euro Millions, …), some combinations are more played than others. It is better to choose combinations rarely played : they have the same probability of draw, but pay much more, because there are fewer winners.


The service works through a crowdsourcing technology, and advanced learning algorithms.

This API allows third party application to check and register combinations into the OneWinner.Me service. 

For the moment, only Euro Millions lottery is available, but more are coming soon.
