Typically, your applications will do this by presenting a form with a file upload field to the user. When the form is submitted, the Blobstore creates a blob from the file's contents and returns an opaque reference to the blob, called a blob key, which you can later use to serve the blob.

It consists of a suite of basic services for simulation and analysis of biochemical reaction networks. The aim of this project is to allow easy integration of COPASI powerful functionalities with other applications and services. One immediate result of this work is that simulation tasks are now available to be used in a platform- and language-independent manner as components of distributed workflows, for example using the workflow management system like Taverna. The CopasiWS uses COPASI command line version (CopasiSE) in the background to carry out the simulation process. CopasiWS simulation results are encoded in Systems Biology Results Markup Language (SBRML) format in order to make further processing of the results very easy for other application and services. SBRML is an XML-based and programming language independent format for encoding systems biology simulation results and experimental data.

Please update your code as necessary. 6/6/2013: Previous versions of the API had the pass info URL as /passinfo.php, however, for consistency, we've moved the page to apiPassInfo.php. We have left the old passinfo.php file in place with an internal re-direct to apiPassInfo.php, but please note that we will remove this file in the future, so please migrate your code if you use this feature.Previous versions of the API had type_id and template_id with underscores. Given that all the other variables are camelcase, we have standardized these both to use camelcase (typeId and templateId). We have added code that should handle either for now, but please note that we may strip out the deprecated version in the future, so please migrate your code if you use that parameter. We've also improved the API by standardizing our error messages a little more. Finally, we've expanded the tracking feature of our API to give you a bit more detail on the state changes of passes.  We're including the URL call for each transaction update so \nthat you can see what changes were made to the pass during updates. If you have any questions or feedback (we're still looking for feedback on cookie-less authentication options and analytics reports), please let us know!

Aside from social applications, organizations are also looking to surface their core enterprise business functionality to an ever expanding array of client platforms. WCF Web API allows developers to expose their applications, data and services to the web directly over HTTP. This allows developers to fully harness the richness of the HTTP as an application layer protocol. Applications can communicate with a very broad set of clients whether they be browsers, mobile devices, desktop applications or other backend services. They can also take advantage of the caching and proxy infrastructure of the web through providing proper control and entity headers. We are designing specifically to support applications built with a RESTful architecture style though it does not force developers to use REST.
