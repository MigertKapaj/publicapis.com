  "description": "The purpose of the RFC is to define a set of straightforward REST (REpresentational State Transfer) services to commonly required information based on the data in GPMDB. These services will provide simple, non-SQL methods to extract this information and make it available over the Internet to anyone wishing to use it as part of a network-aware application. "
