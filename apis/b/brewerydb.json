  "description": "Every request to the BreweryDB API requires an API key to be passed along with the request. An API key is generated automatically for you when you create a new app. Once your app is approved by our staff (typically takes at most a few hours), you will have access to the API. You can register a new app via the My Apps link above. Please keep your API key private!"
