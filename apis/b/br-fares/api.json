  "description": "In order to gauge interest in a professionally supported version, I have decided to publicise the API that the BR Fares website uses to access the fares database. Access to the API is currently free and unrestricted, and it will remain so for low volume use. However very heavy or non-compressed use can currently expect to be blockedâ€”but I don't want to rule out the possibility of introducing a charge for regular use of a professionally-supported API in the future. Queries regarding the API may be directed to info@brfares.com."
