  "description": "Bounce MixedResults is a search service which combines and sorts the results from multiple search engines, just like the \"Find Stuff\" search on the BounceBase sidebar. There are a number of search groups, each of which has an underlying set of search sources. For example, a MixedResults search using the jobs group provides job listings from Monster, SimplyHired, Craigslist, and more."
