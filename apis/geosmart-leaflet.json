  "description": "This document is a guide to using the Maps Javascript API to add rich, interactive maps to your web applications. The API exposes a set of Javascript objects for the creation of maps and map features, and supporting classes for data loading and event management. Familiarity with the Javascript language, especially its object-oriented features will be helpful in working with the API."
