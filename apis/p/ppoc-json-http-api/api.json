  "description": "The Library of Congress' recently re-released Print & Photographs Online Catalog (http://www.loc.gov/pictures/) provides a json serialization of the request-scoped state used to create every html page.Â  This immediately enables PPOC to serve as a simple API for developers to make use of while building other applications, integrating Library data in new and innovative ways."
