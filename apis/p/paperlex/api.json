  "description": "Simple Signatures allows you to rapidly collect signatures for routine contracts with a single signer. Popular examples incldue rental agreements, software license agreements, and NDAs. Instead of fully integrating with the Paperlex API, you simply POST to a special URL; we handle the signature process and POST back to your application, passing data about the signed contract."
