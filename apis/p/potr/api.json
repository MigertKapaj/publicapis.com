  "description": "The POTR SDK is tightly integrated with our Postal Gopher web service. When your customer wants to send a postcard to a contact on their phone that does not have a mailing address, Postal Gopher will send them an email or SMS text message. The contact will have 48 hours to respond with a mailing address. Postal Gopher is included with the POTR SDK so no additional steps are required to take advantage of this service."
