  "description": "Your feedback following our hue launch was clear. You want to use light as you want it. Here we provide you some material to do so. The hue bridge has a powerful RESTful interface, which behaves like a simple web service. Use it as your tool. We hope this will help you to truly use light as you want it, by making new apps, websites and digital installations;integrating hue into something else or just playing around."
