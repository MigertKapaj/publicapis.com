  "description": "In order to build loyalty into your application, you will need to identify and authenticate your loyal users. PunchTab provides multiple ways to authenticate a user as a member of a program. If you don't have an existing authentication layer, or do not want to integrate/leverage your existing authentication system, then we provide our own social login, and email/password login. If you do want to integrate with your existing authentication system, PunchTab can piggy-back on it with our SSO option, so users don't have to create a loyalty account."
