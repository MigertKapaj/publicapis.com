  "description": "On the Foodspotting website and iPhone app when you add a new entry into the system, it is often referred to as a \"spot\" or \"spotting\". But in the underlying system this concept is actually made up of two objects, sightings and reviews. When you spot a new food at a place, what you create is actually a review, which gets associated with a sighting, so it is important to understand the different roles these objects play. "
