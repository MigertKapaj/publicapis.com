  "description": "eBay Feedback DSR APIs provide an easy way to manage account-level Feedback data, specifically Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs). Use the Feedback API to develop DSR-based reports and tools that offer insight into how specific business practices contribute to a sellerÂ’'s DSR scores. DSR data can help sellers understand particular strengths and weaknesses in their business model as well as possible areas for improvement. For example, a particular shipping service may consistently deliver high DSRs, while a items listed in a particular category contribute to most of the lower ratings."
