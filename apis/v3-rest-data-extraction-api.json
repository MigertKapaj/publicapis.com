  "description": "Although Webtrends regularly upgrades and enhances the REST Web Services throughout the year, new versions and announcements are reserved for significant releases in which major new functionality and capability is added.Â  V3 brings with it some features that will make it easier to build your HTML5 dashboards, trend your multi-dimensional data, or build your own localized interface to the data. We've been hard at work (if I do say so myself)"
