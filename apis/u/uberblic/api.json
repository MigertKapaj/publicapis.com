  "description": "The Doppelganger service translates between IDs of entities in third party APIs. When you query Doppelganger with an entity ID, youâ€™ll get back IDs of that same entity in other APIs. In addition, a persistent Uberblic ID serves as an anchor for your application that you can use for subsequent queries."
