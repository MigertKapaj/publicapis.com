  "description": "monitor-specific apiKeys are good for pulling data for a single monitor without revealing your main apiKey (account-specific apiKey). For ex: you can use monitor-specific apiKeys in client websites (so you'll still be able to pull data and the client will only be able to see the monitor-specific apiKey)."
