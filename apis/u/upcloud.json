  "description": "UpCloud enables server resource management in several ways, for instance using our UpCloud Control Panel or a mobile phone app. These management methods are well suited to the most common purposes. However, if you want more sophisticated and automated resource management, traditional UIs are ill-suited. In this case, it is much easier to use our API."
