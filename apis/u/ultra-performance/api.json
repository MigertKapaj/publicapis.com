  "description": "The Ultra Performance API (UPA) is the second Custom API to support the OMM message model. It is meant to complement RFA by providing users with a choice as to the level of API access and functionality that is appropriate to access the Thomson Reuters Enterprise Platform for Real-time. (See below.) If low-level, raw access is needed and some of the features at the RFA layer can be sacrificed, then UPA is for you."
