  "description": "This document will describe the data using terms based on XML Schema. Data can be grouped by namespace, with a schema document describing the elements and types of the namespace. Generally speaking, types define the structure of the data and elements are instances of a type. For example, elements are usually produced by (or consumed by) a REST endpoint, and the structure of each element is described by its type. "
