  "description": "Ninefold's APIs (application programming interfaces) for both storage and compute have now been formally accepted and included in the jclouds (Java/JVM), Fog (Ruby) and Libcloud (Python) libraries. Ninefold has developed a new open source Nuget package to make the APIs more accessible on Microsoft's .NET platform. They are currently looking for developers to build an open source cloud library for PHP."
