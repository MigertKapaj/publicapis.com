  "description": "Using the Opn APIs you create a custom, branded payment application hosted on your own site. The application might be a completely new application such as a customer rewards scheme that allows users to redeem points in the form of a virtual card or the application might be an existing accounting system that you enhance so the company can pay vendors with single-use virtual cards created on-demand for each purchase. During runtime, control passes to a secure Opn server which handles payment logic, identity management, risk and compliance, and interacts with external financial networks to manage the flow of money."
