The service provides real-time market access and direct fiber optic connections to market centers, allowing your system to execute trades at top speed. Our API includes customizable risk management tools to prevent over-buying and over-selling of shares, as well as a live monitoring feature that allows you to track the progress of you trades and get real-time P&L information. While you concentrate on fine-tuning your trading model, we'll handle the technology. "
