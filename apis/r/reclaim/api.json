  "description": "The ReClaim electronic luggage tag is the world’s first luggage tag that can help prevent your luggage from getting lost or delayed for days on end. ReClaim adds online itineraries and 24/7 live customer support so airport officials can quickly route your bag to its correct destination—even if the original airline paper barcode tag is missing or unreadable.  Which lets you spend your time on the beach, not waiting for your bikinis.\n "
