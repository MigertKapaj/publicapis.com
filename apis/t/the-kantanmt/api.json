  "description": "The KantanMT API allows customers to interact with the KantanMT translation facility as an on-demand web service. Users can submit individual segments or groups of segments for \ntranslation, and receive those translations immediately, in contrast to the browser-based KantanMT experience, which performs much larger translation volumes in a “batch” or “job-based” workflow. \n"
