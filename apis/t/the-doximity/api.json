  "description": "The Doximity API allows partners to utilize Doximity’s clinician verification engine to verify the identity of a user and allow the user to authenticate using her Doximity credentials. That’s right, one less username and password for a doctor to remember, less friction during registration and confirmation that the user is a clinician."
