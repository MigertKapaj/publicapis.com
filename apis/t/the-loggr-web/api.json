  "description": "The Loggr Web API enables you to query your log's events and other meta-data about your Loggr account. The API makes it easy to create web \nand desktop applications that integrate with your account. Since the API is based on HTTP principles, it's very easy to write and test \napplications. You can use your browser to access URLs, and you can use pretty much any HTTP client in any programming language to interact with\n the API."
