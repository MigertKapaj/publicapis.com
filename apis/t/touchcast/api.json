  "description": "TouchCast vApps are actually just interactive web pages added on top of video. Usually, videos exist in their own box on web pages. vApps reverse this: they are little boxes of the web inside a video. When you add a vApp to a TouchCast video, you are really adding a viewport in which a web page is displayed."
