  "description": "Tropo provides an easy-to-learn, easy-to-implement scripting environment designed for creating a wide variety of communications applications. Your script runs on our servers, very similar to the way a web application runs on a web server. Instead of interacting with the user via a web browser, however, a Tropo application interacts with the user via voice (using a standard telephone or Voice Over IP/SIP) or text (SMS)."
