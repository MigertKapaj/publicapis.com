  "description": "The TSheets API (Application Programming Interface) is based on REST principles. It's very easy to write and test applications. You can use your browser to access URLs, and you can use pretty much any SSL-capable HTTP client in any programming language to interact with the API. The API allows you to query meta-data about your account, users, jobcodes, timesheets, GPS points, and custom fields. "
