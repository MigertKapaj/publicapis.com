  "description": "Are you suffering from severe restrictions imposed by other mapping softwares? Are you tired of having to sift through unrealistic agreements such as billable vs non-billable,\nbasic key vs commercial key, public facing vs commercial, etc. non-sense? We have a simple business model. We offer multiple APIs for route optimization, tracking tiles, and turn-by-turn directions using one simple key. "
