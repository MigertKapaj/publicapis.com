  "description": "Tiny GeoCoder exists to make geocoding and reverse-geocoding simple and painless. It does both with a simple call to a URL. What’s returned is either a comma delimited (good for use in Google Maps as-is) latitude/longitude pair. If you’re reverse-geocoding it will take a set of lat/long coordinates and return the closest nameable point "
