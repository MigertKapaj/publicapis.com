  "description": "nteractive Voice Response (IVR) systems are everywhere. Now with the ChoiceView Rest API, you can easily upgrade virtually any IVR — new or existing or premises or cloud-based — to provide visual operations. It requires only a script change in the IVR, and your callers benefit from a greatly improved user interface without aggravating voice-only phone trees."
