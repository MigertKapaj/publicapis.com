  "description": "The CB Insights API is based off of the REST web API design model. All responses, including errors, are returned as a JSON by default. Currently JSON is the only option, XML support will follow. The API strives to utilize HTTP features such as HTTP status codes and a custom HTTP authentication scheme, as well as maintaining a URL structure that is simple and consistent. "
