  "description": "This project is an attempt at creating a set of standards for the exchange of climbing data, for example between climbing sites (eg batch importing a large number of routes) or between databases of climbs and clients of that data - such as xslt's to format it as a guidebook for printing, or a mobile application for live route finding while at the crag.
