  "description": "Cocoa is a dense annotator for biological text. It annotates macromolecules, chemicals, protein/DNA parts, complexes, organisms, processes, anatomical parts, locations, physiological terms, parameters, values, experimental techniques, surgical procedures, and foods. The dense annotation cover should suffice to jumpstart a semantic frame -based relation annotator. "
