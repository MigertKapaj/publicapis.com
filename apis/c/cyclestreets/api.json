  "description": "CycleStreets is keen to see widespread use of our API, particularly for mobile use. This policy governs acceptable use and our limitation policy. As an organisation run on a not-for-profit basis run from relatively small amounts of income, our server resources are to some extent limited. However, we aim to provide as full and professional a service as possible, and we are continually improving the routing quality and adding new features."
