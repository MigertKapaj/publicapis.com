  "description": "The Launchpad website lets you learn about and manage bugs, projects, questions, and other artefacts of software development. These same objects are gradually being exposed through a web service, so that you can access them from scripts, applications, or other websites, in addition to accessing them through the Launchpad website. The service is designed around the principles of REST, with the goals of simplicity and transparency. "
