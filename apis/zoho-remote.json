  "description": "The main purpose of Zoho Remote APIs is to allow users to open, edit and save standard desktop documents such as Microsoft Office/Open Office using the respective Zoho web-based editors. The Remote API integration approach brings in the best of both the worlds for partners, enterprises & medium sized businesses - collaborative editing capabilities of an online application while at the same time having the choice of storing data in their own servers. Once the users are done with their edits & press save, the documents are automatically stored in partners document repository. Zoho doesn't keep a copy of them and the partners/enterprises always keep control of their document. "
