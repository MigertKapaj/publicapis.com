  "description": "The VirWoX server has been built using a modern service-oriented architecture, in order to achieve a high degree of scalability and reliablilty. In fact, it has been running 24/7 since 2008 and processing millions of transactions without a glitch.As an additional benefit of this modular architecture, we can now open our internal interfaces to third-party developers who wish to access the VirWoX server from their own applications or products, or to build new exciting applications that require programmatic access to a virtual currency exchange. VirWoX is the first and only exchange for virtual currencies with an open programming interface."
