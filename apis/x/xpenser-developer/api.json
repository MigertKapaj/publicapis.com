  "description": "OAuth is a newer method for gaining access to protected resources. It offers several advantages over HTTP Basic Authentication - in particular, it does not require the user's username and password be known when invoking the APIs. We encourage you to make use of OAuth instead of HTTP Basic Auth where possible."
