  "description": "The API comes in three flavours: JSON(P) and HTML. The format will be determined by the HTTP Accept header and the X-Requested-With header: If you ask for application/json (or any other MIME type with json in it) or if the HTTP header X-Requested-With is set to XMLHttpRequest you will get a JSON response.If you trigger a JSONP call (see each call for more details) you will get a JSONP response.Otherwise you will get the same HTML page that you would get when using the web interface."
