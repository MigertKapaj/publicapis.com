  "description": "This API is design so that a resource obtained via GET or POST can be sent back in a PUT request unchanged. So when sending a PUT request the additional parameters are ignored (e.g. created_at, updated_at, id, etc). Since these parameters could stop being ignored in the future, it is recommended to either not send them, or to take care of sending them unchanged."
