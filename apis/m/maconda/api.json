  "description": "MaConDa API (application programming interface) consists of the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) / WSDL (Web Services Description Language) interface. The users can access MaConDa by the SOAP technology over   the HTTP protocol.  This makes it easy to build a   client library for a specific programming language.  This enables the users to write their own scripts to access the database. "
