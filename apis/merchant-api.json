  "description": "We also offer a secure Merchant API that allows Merchants to hook up their existing shopping cart or current checkout process directly to their wallet in order for them to easily generate a payment address and check the moment funds are received at these generated address. On top of all of this within the wallet there are also some useful tools; For example you can export your wallet TX data in either Excel or PDF format thus simplifying greatly your accounting needs."
