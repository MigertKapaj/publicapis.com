  "description": "The AS3 API allows users to control the YouTube video players by loading the player into a Flash application and making calls via ActionScript to the player's public API. Your application can use a chromeless player, for which you will build custom controls in Flash, or an embedded player that has built-in controls. Calls can be made to play, pause, seek to a certain time in a video, set the volume, mute the player, and other useful functions. The ActionScript API is automatically activated when the player is loaded into another SWF."
