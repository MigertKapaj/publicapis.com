  "description": "After running an open beta for a few month's I worked with a bunch of the 'power players' to work out what they wanted out of the stats that they were tracking. The result was a deeper analysis of their scores which then enabled a ton of cool player comparisons and sport graphs. And even now, Athletable is growing and changing each day with feedback from players. "
