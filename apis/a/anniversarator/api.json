  "description": "The Anniversarator web page can also be used as a simple REST web service by third-party applications. This means that if you have a facebook application, a mobile application, or some other web service, and you want to be able to incorporate the results of the Anniversarator's calculations into your application, you can do that using a simple HTTP call to the page with the appropriate parameters."
