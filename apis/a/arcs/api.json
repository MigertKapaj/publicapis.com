  "description": "ARCS is an acronym for Application Resource Control Service. It is a standard service that is specifically designed for controlling the use of application resources. ARCS fulfills the needs of resource locking, concurrency control, user counting, etc. A resource is anything that two or more entities, such as users, compete for. Examples of a resource include: a user-license, a suite of SQL tables/records, an installation process, a reservation, etc."
