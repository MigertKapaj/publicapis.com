  "description": "The Anedot REST API allows you to query meta-data about your account, campaigns, donations, and donors. Since the API is based on REST principles, it's very easy to write and test applications. You can use your browser to access URLs, and you can use pretty much any HTTP client in any programming language to interact with the API."
