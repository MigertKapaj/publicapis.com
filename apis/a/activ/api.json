  "description": "The ACTIV APIs are perhaps the most advanced, modern, and thorough interface to market data available anywhere. These lightweight libraries are available in C++, Java and C# and are supported on over 30 OS/Compiler combinations including 32 & 64-bit versions of Windows, Solaris, and Linux. Through the Content Gateway individual subscription watch lists are retrievable by a powerful set of methods including single instrument, wildcard, exchange, or entire asset classes. "
