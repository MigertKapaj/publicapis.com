  "description": "CarQuery API is an easy to use JSON based API for retrieving detailed car information, including year, make, model, trim, and specifications. Using CarQuery API is as simple as including a javascript file, and inserting a few lines of script in your page. You can also write your own javascript or server-side API interactions to use the available data any way you like. "
