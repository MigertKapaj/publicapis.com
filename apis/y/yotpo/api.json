  "description": "In Yotpo we have Users and Accounts. Each user, usually, has one account but can have more. Each such account, is described using an app_key. You will need this app_key, for most actions in the API. Most of the Yotpo API calls are restriced to authenticated users only, and require a utoken (user token). "
