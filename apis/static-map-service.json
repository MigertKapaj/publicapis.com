  "description": "Generating a static map image is as easy as just sending in a center point and a zoom level.  The method \"getmap\" takes a latitude/longitude pair and will center the static map image over that center point. It can also take a latitude/longitude pair as an upper left corner and one for a lower right corner and will then create the map based on those bounds."
