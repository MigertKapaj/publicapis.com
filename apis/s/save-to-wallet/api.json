  "description": "The Save-To-Wallet API is part of the vision for Google Wallet to be the one-stop-shop for holding everything you'd carry in a regular wallet. The Offers component of this API allows customers to save offers directly from a Merchant's web property into Google Wallet with the click of a button. Google Wallet reminds users to visit your store before the offer expires. Customers redeem offers by showing the offer code at the point of sale or by tapping their NFC enabled phone. The point of sale recognizes the offer code and applies the offer to the basket. "
