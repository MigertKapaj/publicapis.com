  "description": "The Swiftype Search API is a powerful full-text search API that gives you full programatic control over the content in your search engine, while still allowing you to use the Swiftype Dashboard for controlling your search engine's behavior. The Search API should be employed by users who wish to bypass the Web Crawling aspect of engine creation and updating. "
