  "description": "Semantria provides a REST API, which is compliant with all REST standards. It communicates solely though secure HTTPS connections and supports JSON and XML formats for client-server communication. The API is asynchronous, meaning data cannot be downloaded and uploaded through the use of one API call; however, it is designed for heavy loads, near-realtime speeds and large volumes of content."
