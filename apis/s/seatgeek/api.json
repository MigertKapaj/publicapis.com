  "description": "SeatGeek is a ticket search site that aggregates sports, concert, and theater ticket listings from over 60 ticketing sites -- including StubHub and TicketsNow.\r\n\r\nThe SeatGeek API provides developers with broad access to the companyâ€™s dataset of nearly 100,000 live events. The RESTful API returns requests in JSON, JSONP, and XML and can provide detailed information on venue lat/lon, average ticket price, seating location, and more. SeatGeek has a community portal that keeps a record of all support conversations and is a useful tool when looking to get questions answered. \r\n\r\nSites can also monetize their content with SeatGeek's API by registering in SeatGeek's Partner Program. Each time a partner sends a referral to SeatGeek and they purchase a ticket, SeatGeek will pay their partner 50% of the revenue earned on that transaction. Currently users are averaging $11 per sale generated."
