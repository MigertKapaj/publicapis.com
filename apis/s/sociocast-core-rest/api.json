  "description": "This area is for application developers who want detailed information about the Sociocast REST API, in order to better understand the various methods and/or plan on building custom libraries against the API. This section is targeted for developers who have an understanding of RESTful web services and basic understanding of HTTP request/response frameworks. Additionally, many of the examples utilize cURL and JSON, so knowledge of these two are important."
