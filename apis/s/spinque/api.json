  "description": "With Spinque, there is no pre-defined search engine. You can design your own search engine, following the logical process that seems more reasonable to you. The result of this design (which happens via a graphical interface) is what we call a strategy. Strategies can be saved, changed, shared, optimised and ultimately published as stand-alone search engines."
