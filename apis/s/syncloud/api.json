  "description": "SynCloud is an easy way for developers to add multi-user syncing into their iOS CoreData applications. Provide a mechanism for your users to easily collaborate to manage their application data, all while generating revenue for your app. Its awin-win for everyone! Apple's iCloud is a great way for you to provide a way for users to transfer their data to all of their own devices, but since iCloud syncing only supports a single user, it falls short for those of us who want to provide Mulit-User syncing."
