  "description": "MicroPoll's Integration Platform is an on-demand framework that powers the Survey Software. The Integration API allows developers to write integration applications through a single set of object-oriented interfaces. Built on platform independent technologies like Java, XML, HTTP and XML-RPC, integration partners can pick and choose their development tools to integrate with MicroPoll.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          "
