  "description": "The Gliffy Developer Program has been created with a simple vision in mind: We wanted to make it possible for developers to add Gliffy diagramming features to their existing web based applications.We've accomplised this goal by creating a simple to use developer framework which in turn makes it easy to create mash-ups with Gliffy."
