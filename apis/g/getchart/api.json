  "description": "The GetChart API generates a URL for an image file that displays historical Zestimates for a specific property. The API accepts as input the Zillow Property ID as well as a chart type: either percentage or dollar value change. Optionally, the API accepts width and height parameters that constrain the size of the image. The historical data can be for the past 1 year, 5 years or 10 years. "
