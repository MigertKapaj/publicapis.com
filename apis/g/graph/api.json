  "description": "The Graph API is a simple way to access, publish and modify data on Dailymotion. The Graph API presents a simple, consistent view of the Dailymotion objects (e.g., users, videos, playlists, etc.) and connections between them (e.g., friend relationship, userâ€™s posted videos, videos in groups/playlits, etc.)."
