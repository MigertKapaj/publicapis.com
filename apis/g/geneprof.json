  "description": "The GeneProf Web Services enable programmatic access to the public data stored in GeneProf's databases via a simple web service API. GeneProf is a web-based data analysis for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments that is coupled with a database of ready-analysed experiments. As such, GeneProf constitutes a rich and growing, high-quality resource for information about gene expression and regulation and the GeneProf web services further allow computational biologists and software developers to utilise these data from external software and websites.
