  "description": "The Netflix Javascript API allows subscribers to add, save, or instantly watch movies from pages on your web site. You include this API on a page with a single line of JavaScript. To try it out, sign up as a Netflix developer, find your consumer key (sometimes called the \"API key\" or just your \"key\") in My Keys, and place the <script> element shown in the examples below in your page at the place where you want the add, save, or watch buttons to show up."
