  "description": "The DomainTools API provides direct access to the same data that drives the powerful research tools on DomainTools.com. It is designed for server-to-server communication between your system and the DomainTools network using standard HTTP or HTTPS requests. The API can provide responses in both JSON and XML formats and offers a RESTful URL structure for most queries. You can authenticate securely using HMAC authentication (described in detail below) or with simple key/value pairs in the request. "
