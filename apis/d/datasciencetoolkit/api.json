  "description": "As an emulation of Yahoo's service, a good place to start is their Placemaker documentation. There's also concrete examples of how to call the Placemaker API in the test_suite folder, and for Javascript in the source of the home page of this server. I've focused on supporting the most commonly used features of Yahoo's interface, so if you have some code that relies on something that's missing, email me a sample of your source and I'll do my best to add that in."
