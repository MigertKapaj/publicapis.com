  "description": "The web service discussed in this document is an interface to the MusicBrainz Database. It is aimed at developers of media players, CD rippers, taggers, and other applications requiring music metadata. The service's architecture follows the REST design principles. Interaction with the web service is done using HTTP and all content is served in a simple but flexible XML format. "
