  "description": "The DocuSignÂ® REST API provides you with a powerful, convenient, and simple Web services API for interacting with DocuSign. The REST API uses the same underlying data model and standard objects as those in the DocuSign SOAP-based API. The REST API also has the same limits imposed on it as the SOAP-based API. See the Getting Started section for more information on prerequisites and limits."
