  "description": "The Datafeedr API (Application Programming Interface) allows users to query our product database programmatically (ie. by writing programming code). Each query is referred to as an API Request, a request made to the API which returns products as an array. The API does not handle anything other than allowing you to query the database and returning products. It does not insert products into your database or display them on your website. This functionality must be handled separately by a developer."
