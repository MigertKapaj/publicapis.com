  "description": "BugSense was created by developers for developers out of simple necessity: we wanted to monitor our apps in the wild and make sure they were always stable & fun to use. To meet this need, we came up with an app-monitoring solution that takes no more than 2 minutes to install, leaves a small footprint, and delivers huge value. "
