  "description": "This is an application programming interface (API) that opens up core EU legislative data for further use. The interface uses JSON, meaning that you have easy to use machine-readable access to meta data on European Union legislation. It will be useful if you want to use or analyze European Union legislative data in a way that the official databases are not originally build for."
