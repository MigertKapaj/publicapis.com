  "description": "The Transaction Processing API is a web service that allows third-party applications to process transactions through E-xact's system.  The range of processing scenarios (Purchase, Refund, Pre-Authorization, etc.) enable flexible and powerful ways to implement custom business logic.  E-xact also provides free client libraries that ease integration with the API. "
