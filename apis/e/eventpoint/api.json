We give you entry points to quickly deploy solutions for sessions, speakers, meetings, expo, surveys, and more. All modules are supported by the EventPoint Core Services which includes robust reporting (seriously - it's awesome), mobile versions of everything, 2 flavors of web api, a business intelligence data feed, and of course your own website.
