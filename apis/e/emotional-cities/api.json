  "description": "Emotional Cities poses a very everyday question. But what would happen if we took more time to reflect over how we ourselves, and others around us, are feeling? Can a few minutes of daily reflection make us more aware? Emotional Cities is an art project that studies and visualizes the emotions of individuals and groups."
