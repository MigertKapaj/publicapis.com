  "description": "With the expressFlow API you can easily integrate complex file-processing tasks into your applications - just by sending simple HTTP requests to the expressFlow REST API.\nThe fundamental principle of the expressFlow REST API is: Everything is in the Cloud. This principle radically changes the performance and the integration complexity of the API. You just need to send a link referring to the resource you want to process, and expressFlow does the REST for you ;-) \n                                                      "
