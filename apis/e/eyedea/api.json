  "description": "API uses REST-like interface. This means that all calls to the API are made over the Internet, using HTTP GET and POST requests to the API server (http://face.eyedea.cz/api). Any programming language that can be used to communicate over HTTP can be used for client-side implementations. Photo can be uploaded directly in the API request. A requests that \nuploads a photo must be formed as a MIME multi-part message sent using POST data. Each argument, including the raw image data, should be specified as a separate chunk of form data. \n"
