  "description": "Asterank offers a basic queryable database for NASA's Kepler Project. It is a simple way to quickly apply constraints to a set of over 2,000 exoplanets and unconfirmed \"objects of interest.\" The database supports comparators and specific criteria for all attributes provided by the Kepler Data Explorer.
