  "description": "We offer you the opportunity to earn extra revenue with LocalGuiding \ntours and activities. You can use simple affiliate links, banners, our \nAPI or white label solutions to display the LocalGuiding tours on your \nwebsite. You can decide what range of tours you want to refer â€“ you can \nrefine it by region, country and category / activity type (e.g. only \nwalking tours in Buenos Aires). We track all bookings referred by your \nsite for up to 6 months and pay you your commission after each month.\n                                        "
