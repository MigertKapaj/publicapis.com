  "description": "At Steer, we teach an awesome front-end development course where we teach things like HTML, CSS and Javascript. One thing our students ask about a lot is using Twitter on their sites but recently Twitter changed their API to only accepting authenticated requests. For beginners, it's really hard to implement so we've made a simple way.\n    "
