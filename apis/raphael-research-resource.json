  "description": "With the Raphael Research Resource, The National Gallery, London, and its partners are pleased to present this wealth of information to specialists and the general public alike. Initially this project was based on the extensive studies of the ten paintings by Raphael in the Gallery collection, but it has now been developed to hold information provided by a number of other institutions and collaborators."
