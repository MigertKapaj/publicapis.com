  "description": "Repustate's sentiment analysis allows you to determine the sentiment (how people \"feel\" about a particular topic) from any data source you have access to. Like most of Repustate's API calls, you have a choice of how to specify your arguments. You can supply one of a block of text, a single URL, or a list of URLs."
