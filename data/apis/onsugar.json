  "description": "Fetching content from OnSugar is easy: just append the API call to http://[sitename].onsugar.com/ and you'll get a structured version of your content in either JSON or XML. When using JSON the output will be sent as a Javascript object assigned to a variable named onsugar_api.Â To access private methods you will need to authenticate your request by posting two additional arguments - login and password. Additionally, POST methods take an optional parameter callback which will return the response in either XML or JSON."
