  "description": "The GetRateSummary API returns the current rates per loan type — as well as rates from a week ago — from Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. Current supported loan types are 30-year fixed, 15-year fixed, and 5/1 ARM. Rates are computed from real quotes borrowers receive from lenders just seconds before the rate data is returned. The GetRateSummary API returns rates for a specific state if the optional state parameter is used. "
