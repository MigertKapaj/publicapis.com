  "description": "Paramaters and calls are passed following the HTTP GET convention. We reccomend, for best reliability, passing them in a URL-friendly form (replacing spaces with %20, for example) Each API call returns an XML document. Some fields may be packaged as a CDATA item, because they may include HTML, such as video or map embedding code, designed to be displayed unmodified.\n\n        "
