  "description": "NEOS runs an XML-RPC server to communicate with clients for submitting and retrieving jobs.  The server can communicate with clients written in Python, Perl, PHP, C, C++, Java, Ruby, and probably other languages as well.  More information on XML-RPC and writing clients can be found at http://www.xmlrpc.com or http://tldp.or /HOWTO/XML-RPC-HOWTO/index.html.  Any NEOS job submitted using the XML-RPC API must be formulated in the XML format required by the desired solver.  More information on this format can be found by following the'XML-RPC' link on the solver's page.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
