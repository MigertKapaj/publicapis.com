  "description": "The Open Elevation Service provides elevation profile information such as elevation and distance given a lat/lng pair in JSON or XML formats. Here Distance refers to the accumulated distance along the path specified by the lat/lng collection. Each elevation/distance pair in response is then mapped to the corresponding lat/lng in the request."
