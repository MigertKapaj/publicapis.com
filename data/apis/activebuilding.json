  "description": "ActiveBuilding API uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. All requests to the API must be made over SSL (https://, not http://). ActiveBuilding only supports the password grant_type: clients send a username and password and receive an access_token (2-legged oauth authentication)."
