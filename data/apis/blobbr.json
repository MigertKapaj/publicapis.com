  "description": "The Blobbr API is a RESTful API. Each call requires a specific request type (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE). The documentation states which request type is required but the general rule is GET to request data, POST to add or edit a record, PUT to flag a record, and DELETE to delete a record."
