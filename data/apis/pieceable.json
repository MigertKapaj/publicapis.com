  "description": "Pieceable Software and we make Pieceable Viewer, the first product that lets iOS app publishers deliver their apps to the browser.\n    It's a cool piece of technology, and our customers use it in a bunch of different ways.  It's a sales tool for B2B iOS developers. It's a demo tool for contractors working with remote clients.  Sometimes it's a web-based marketing tool.  And, other times it's used by customer support departments that need to support iOS apps.\n    "
