  "description": "This is one of our fun APIs.  Our goal is to eventually have this API return different interesting statistics.  Right now we only support \"latestStyles\" (i.e. What was just bought on Zappos.com).The Zappos API team is going to continue and invest a lot in these stats.  We think this where the most interesting mash-ups will come from.  Building a travel app and want to find what is being bought in that city right now?  This api will help facilitate that soon enough."
