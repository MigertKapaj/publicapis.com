  "description": "The FAXAGE Internet Fax API allows for the FAXAGE service to be used as a fax back end - integrated into your systems or software. The API can be used to fax-enable ERP and other back-office systems that need the capability to fax. It can also be used to create a white label fax service - allowing you to get into the email fax business while avoiding expensive infrastructure and R&D investments."
