  "description": "DandyID's API gives developers the ability to create better social networks by allowing users to more clearly define who they are, helping them to connect with one another on a more personal level, and making it easier for new users to get up and running more quickly. User experience is important, and users on DandyID-enabled sites form tighter bonds with each other and connect in more meaningful ways. DandyID tools can help you turn casual visitors into die-hard fans."
