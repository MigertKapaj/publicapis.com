  "description": "The QuickPay API is an open protocol that enables merchants to handle payments in a simple manner. The protocol is based on SSL encrypted HTTP communication and all actions are perfomed by sending a HTTP POST request to https://secure.quickpay.dk/api (See Example  1). Upon each request sent, QuickPay will respond with a simple XML document (See Example 2). Please notice: do not send API requests to https://secure.quickpay.dk/form/. /form/ is only for authorizes using the Quickpay Payment Window."
