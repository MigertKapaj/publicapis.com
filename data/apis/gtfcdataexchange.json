  "description": "This site is designed to help developers and transit agencies efficiently share and retrieve GTFS data. GTFS-data-exchange helps eliminate the time between feed publication by a transit agency and when the developer is alerted to it's presence. This is accomplished by per-agency RSS feeds that developers and other GTFS consumers subscribe to."
