  "description": "We believe that all such compelling applications, although possibly quite diverse by nature, have a common ingredient at their core: They are fueled by and adapt to data. Lots of data. Furthermore, as users interact with them this generates even more data -- usage data that needs to be captured, analyzed and learnt from. The Cxense EIE is Big Data defined. In order to provide a solid and future-proof foundation for powering such engaging user experiences, the Cxense EIE is a cloud-based platform serving some key business needs."
