  "description": "The CloudCracker API provides a distinct JSON-based REST endpoint for each supported format. Those endpoints provide four major pieces of functionality: querying an endpoint for the available dictionary options, submitting a cracking job, submitting payment for a cracking job, and querying the status of a submitted job."
