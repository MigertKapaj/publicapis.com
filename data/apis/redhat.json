  "description": "The OpenShift forum is a central location for discussion around building and deploying applications.  It is recommended that you search before opening an issue - it's possible someone has already solved your particular problem!\nThe #openshift IRC channel on freenode is the easiest way to talk directly to a developer, evangelist, or community expert.\nOpenShift team members watch the 'openshift' tag on StackOverflow - a great Q&A site for everything development related."
