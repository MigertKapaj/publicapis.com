  "description": "In order to optimise bandwidth, a retrieval depth can be specified which will determine how much information will be retrieved. The default is to get a basic object back with no extra information. However, all names, thumbnails, participations and other items can be requested using the retrieval depth parameter. For instance, asking for a list of albums and thumbnails may be appropriate, but a detailed list of album participations may be overkill. "
